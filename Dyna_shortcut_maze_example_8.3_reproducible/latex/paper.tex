\section{Experimental Results}

This figure compares the cumulative reward of several RL algorithms with incorporated planning.
They are solving an episodic problem of getting from point A to point B on a grid.
The trick is that when half of epochs are completed, a new, more efficient pathway is opened.
Versions with advanced exploration with various parameters perform much better than simple eps-greedy exploration.
